# HHS-Region-Numbers-by-State

I couldn't find a `.csv` file that maps states to the [Department of Health and Human Services Region Numbers](https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/regional-offices/index.html), so I manually made one. You can see how I do the data processing in the notebook.

Maybe this will help someone else.
